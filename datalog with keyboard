1. use Keyboard extension, and an open excel spreadsheet to log your data
2. log some data values from sensors (the light level, the temperature, the tilting, etc)

- Trigger the datalogging by button A
- when logging the data, light up some LEDs to green so you know your device is working

- datalog example:
keyboard.type("" + control.millis() / 1000 + String.fromCharCode(9))
  - you write the value from some of the sensor + String.fromCharCode(9) (------> this is equal to the button "Enter"
  
  keyboard.functionKey(KeyboardFunctionKey.LeftArrow, KeyboardKeyEvent.Press)
  - this is to move around the Excel sheet with your arrows
  - you have to navigate the action back to the beginning of the next line!!
